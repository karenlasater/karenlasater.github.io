# Karen Lasater

## Bio
Lasater is a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Nursing [Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research](http://www.nursing.upenn.edu/chopr/Pages/default.aspx) and a fellow at the [Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics](http://ldi.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Her dissertation examined the effects of hospital nursing on the likelihood of readmission for older adults following total hip and arthroplasty.
Lasater's research interests include understanding: (1) how to organize nursing care to influence patient outcomes and promote safety and (2) how nurses add value to health care systems.
